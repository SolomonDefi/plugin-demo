# Solomon Decom Plugin

A demo of the Solomon Decom plugin, in the form of a traditional ecommerce site.

## Plugin Dependency

Until stabilized, this project relies on a local link to the `@solomon/plugin` [library](https://github.com/solomondefi/plugin), which it expects at the relative path `../plugin`.

## Usage

This project is build on Vue3, Vite, and Postcss. We recommend PNPM instead of NPM to save time and disk space.
